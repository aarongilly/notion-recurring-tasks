# notion-recurring-tasks
A template for setting up Notion recurring tasks using Google Apps Script.

Requires you to create your own integration with Notion, but this is spectacularly short easy. The instructions walk you through that bit.

# End Result

A tasks database with a "Recur" property that will automatically move due dates and uncomplete the "Done" checkbox for you every night.
